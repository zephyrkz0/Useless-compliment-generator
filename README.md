# Useless-compliment-generator
A team effort by Kasinath R, Alen Alias Cheriyan, and Job Joseph, made as part of the Useless Competition event hosted by @tinkerhub on 20 August 2024. This program uses Computer Vision and compliments you in an overexaggerated way by identifying your distinct facial features, facial expression, and dressing. It uses OpenCV to process the image.
